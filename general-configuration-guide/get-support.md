## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: The icons are missing when installing on my server?

TinyMCE 4 uses Web fonts for its icons. Some web servers do not support the mime types needed for the font file extensions. Below are the mime types needed - the first part is the mime type the second part is the file extension that needs to be mapped. It's in apache mime type format. Other servers might need a different format.

| MIME type                     | File Extension |
|:------------------------------|:---------------|
| application/x-font-ttf        | ttf  |
| application/x-font-otf        | otf  |
| application/font-woff         | woff |
| application/vnd.ms-fontobject | eot  |
| image/svg+xml                 | svg  |



### Q: Why do buttons/select boxes have the incorrect size?

You are probably using an old `DOCTYPE` as of TinyMCE 4 a proper HTML5 doctype is required. All web developers should use a standards rendering mode on their web pages. Use a HTML5 doctype like `<!DOCTYPE html>` to properly render the page and the TinyMCE UI.

### Q: Is TinyMCE protected against XSS vulnerabilities?

The server should have protection against XSS attacks implemented. Since if you can submit contents in a form using TinyMCE one could as easily disable all JavaScript and therefore bypass TinyMCE filtering and still submit HTML code with insecure content. You need to properly filter the HTML input on the server using things like [HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/).

### Q: How do I convert my URLs to relative, absolute, or absolute with the domain?

#### Relative URLs

The **Relative URLs** converts all URLs within the same domain to relative URLs. The URLs are relative from the `document_base_url`.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : true,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
```

##### Example

`http://www.site.com/path1/path2/file.htm >> path2/file.htm`

#### Absolute URLs

The **Absolute URLs** converts all relative URLs to absolute URLs. The URLs are `absolute` based on the `document_base_url`.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : false,
  remove_script_host : true,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
```

##### Example

`path2/file.htm >> /path1/path2/file.htm`

#### Domain absolute URLs

The **Domain absolute URLs** converts all relative URLs to absolute URLs. The URLs are `absolute` based on the `document_base_url` with the domain.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  relative_urls : false,
  remove_script_host : false,
  document_base_url : 'http://www.site.com/path1/'
});
```

##### Example

`path2/file.htm >> http://www.site.com/path1/path2/file.htm`

### Q: Where are the advanced image options?

Use the [`Style Formats`]({{ site.baseurl }}/configure/content-filtering/#style_formats) option instead, which is much more powerful.

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: 'textarea',  // change this value according to your HTML
  style_formats: [
    {title: 'Image Left', selector: 'img', styles: {
      'float' : 'left',
      'margin': '0 10px 0 10px'
    }},
    {title: 'Image Right', selector: 'img', styles: {
      'float' : 'right',
      'margin': '0 10px 0 10px'
    }}
]
});
```

If you wish to align the image, you can also use the text-align buttons when having images selected.
