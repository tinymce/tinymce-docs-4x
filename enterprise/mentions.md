It is now possible for users to send notifications to other users using the Mentions plugin through an `@username` in the document. Using `@username` for notifications are incredibly commonplace in social software such as Twitter and Facebook along with social enterprise applications such as IBMâ€™s Connections suite.

Users can communicate every day using `@username` on social networks and can expect to be able to use them when creating content too.

### Buy TinyMCE Mentions

Mentions is available as a stand-alone plugin or as part of the Pro Bundle. To learn more about all the options, check out the [pricing and plans here](https://apps.tiny.cloud/products/atmention/). OEM and enterprise customers should [contact sales directly](https://www.tiny.cloud/contact/).

There are two deployment options. One is with TinyMCE Cloud, the other is the more traditional Self-hosted route, requiring an additional [server-side component]({{ site.baseurl }}/enterprise/server/) to be installed and configured.

Please note that this feature requires a backend integration with a system to handle listing of users, as well as sending the notifications. Refer to this [example code]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/mentions/#example) for more information. There are two integration points: getting a user list when `@abc...` is typed, and on submitting the form, sending a notification to the `@username` in the document.
